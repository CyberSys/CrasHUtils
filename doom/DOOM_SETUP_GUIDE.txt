    DOOM Node Setup Guide
===================================

AUTO-DOWNLOAD FEATURE:
======================
✓ The DOOM node now AUTOMATICALLY downloads
  the required files if they're missing!

Just add the DOOM node to your workflow and wait
30-60 seconds for the first-time download.

No manual setup needed!

HOW IT WORKS:
=============
1. Add DOOM node to ComfyUI
2. Node checks for DOOM.EXE and DOOM1.WAD
3. If missing, automatically downloads from archive.org
4. Extracts the files to this folder
5. Launches DOOM!

FILES DOWNLOADED:
=================
- DOOM.EXE (DOS executable)
- DOOM1.WAD (game data)

Source: DOOM Shareware v1.9 from archive.org
Legal: This is the official free shareware version

MANUAL SETUP (if auto-download fails):
======================================
1. Download DOOM Shareware:
   https://archive.org/details/DoomsharewareEpisode
   
2. Extract and find DOOM.EXE and DOOM1.WAD

3. Copy both files to this folder:
   ComfyUI/custom_nodes/CrasHUtils/doom/

4. Restart ComfyUI and refresh browser

KEYBOARD CONTROLS:
==================
- Click the canvas to activate keyboard input

- This allows seamless switching between playing and
  using ComfyUI normally
